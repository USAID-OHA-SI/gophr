\description{
Launches the USAID managed, Known Data Issues Tracker.

The Known Data Issues Tracker is a table that summarizes different issues
that are known in DATIM but cannot be resolved. For example, when a treatment
partner start/ends mid-year, there will be duplicated targets that cannot be
adjusted in DATIM.

The list of known issues is maintained by USAID/SIEI division. To access the
table requires having a USAID email account.
